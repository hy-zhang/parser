\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedwork}

- extensible parsing, language workbenches: rats, noa (this one already uses OA), modular semantic actions, (syntactic modularity, no separate compilation, modular type-checking)
(read more papers, see if they talk about this issue, some potential solutions)

- parser combinators for type-checking, previous work has not shown how to support modularity (ASTs); left-recursion and back-tracking in related techniques

- modularity: object algebras, dtc and mrm (problem with parsing, is there any related work? (PB: a paper on unfolds: build the AST))

(parsing in Javascript: using delegation, does it support modular AST)

noa, shy: shy: only override some interesting cases (transformation is tedious)
bruijn indices: parsing + transformation
