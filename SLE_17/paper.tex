%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
  Over the years a lot of effort has been put on solving
  extensibility problems, while retaining important software
  engineering properties such as modular type-safety and
  separate compilation. Most previous work focused on
  operations that traverse and process extensible Abstract Syntax Tree
  (AST) structures. However, there is almost no work on operations that
  \emph{build} such extensible ASTs, including \emph{parsing}.

  This paper investigates solutions for the problem of \emph{modular
    parsing}. We focus on \emph{semantic} modularity and not just
  \emph{syntactic} modularity. That is, the solutions should not only
  allow complete parsers to be built out of modular parsing
  components, but also enable the parsing components to be
  \emph{modularly type-checked} and \emph{separately compiled}. We
  present a technique based on parser combinators that enables modular
  parsing. Interestingly, the modularity requirements for modular
  parsing rule out several existing parser combinator approaches,
  which rely on some non-modular techniques. We show that Packrat
  parsing techniques, provide solutions for such modularity problems,
  and enable reasonable performance in a modular setting.
  Extensibility is achieved using \emph{multiple inheritance} and
  \emph{Object Algebras}.  To evaluate
  the approach we conduct a case study based on the ``Types and
  Programming Languages'' interpreters. The case study shows the
  effectiveness at reusing parsing code from existing interpreters,
  and the total parsing code is 69\% shorter than an existing code
  base using a non-modular parsing approach.
